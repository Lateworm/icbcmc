    <h1>ICBC Motorcycle Insurance Rate Classes</h1>

    <h2>Rate Classes by Power Output Range</h2>
    <p>For each of ICBC's four major motorcycle rate classes, this chart shows the range of power output (horsepower) produced by motorcycles covered. Even though the chart reflects only mainstream ICEs, it clearly demonstrates the redundancy and incongruence of the Rate Classes.</p>

    </br>
    <p>Zero and Boss Hoss produce outliers on the power spectrum. Including those products in the chart below further emphasizes the inability of ICBC's classes to sensibly handle the products on the market. Including them may represent only a fraction of ownership, but is not unfair since both manufacturers produce road legal products and have dealer locations in BC.</p>
